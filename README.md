# Excel Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the `openpyxl` library to perform data analysis on an Excel file. The script loads an Excel workbook, extracts data from a specific sheet, and calculates the number of records meeting a specific condition. In this example, the condition is that the product of the rate and hours worked is greater than 3000.
